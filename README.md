### Hello all!

~~This is the new website, as some had issues with the Google Drive link.~~  
~~If you prefer that, it is still available (and has more information) at [GoogleSheet.HolidayLight.Show](https://googlesheet.holidaylight.show).~~  
~~Some people have reported it works if you _don't_ open with the Google Drive app on your phone, instead using your web browser.~~  

As of the 2025 holiday season preparations, this is the *only* website for status information, schedule, etc. The Google Drive variant has been decommissioned.

### Information:

Work has started - if you drive by, you may see blinky lights, but it is not ready yet. Two major components have been replaced, with at least one more major component needing to be prepared and replaced. Check back later this month (September 2025) for more information.  

# Current status:

Preparing for the 2025 Q4 holiday season.

As always, you can [contact me](https://r.ageek.us/mnbWuX) if you have questions, concerns, etc.


### Next holiday:

Probably Halloween.


#### Reminder:

The link "holidaylight.show" should always work, even if the site moves again or similar. Note that it does *not* have the WWW in front, however the page you are viewing now does.
