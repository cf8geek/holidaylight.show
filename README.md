### Hello all!
This is the new website, as some had issues with the Google Drive link.  
If you prefer that, it is still available (and has more information) at [GoogleSheet.HolidayLight.Show](https://googlesheet.holidaylight.show).  
Some people have reported it works if you _don't_ open with the Google Drive app on your phone, instead using your web browser.

### Information:
Plays on a loop per schedule, unless manually intervened with.
- **Location:** 3920 8th Street, Des Moines, IA 50313
