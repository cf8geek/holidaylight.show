### Hello all!

As of the 2025 holiday season preparations, this is the *only* website for status information, schedule, etc. The Google Drive variant has been decommissioned.

### Information:

Waiting on glue to dry! Check back later (Mid-October 2025) for more information. 

# Current status:

Preparing for the 2025 Q4 holiday season.

As always, you can [contact me](https://r.ageek.us/mnbWuX) if you have questions, concerns, etc.


### Next holiday:

Probably Halloween.


#### Reminder:

The link "holidaylight.show" should always work, even if the site moves again or similar. Note that it does *not* have the WWW in front, however the page you are viewing now does.
