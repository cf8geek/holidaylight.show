### Hello all!
This is the new website, as some had issues with the Google Drive link.  
If you prefer that, it is still available (and has more information) at [GoogleSheet.HolidayLight.Show](https://googlesheet.holidaylight.show).  
Some people have reported it works if you _don't_ open with the Google Drive app on your phone, instead using your web browser.

### Information:
More information will be published later.

# Current status:
Maintenance finished "enough". Sequencing starting soon.  
**Estimated "ready" time:** mid-December.  
**Check back:** early December for updates!

As always, you can [contact me](https://r.ageek.us/mnbWuX) if you have questions, concerns, etc.

### Setlist:
1. Little Drummer Boy
1. First Snow
1. To be announced...

#### Reminder:
The link "holidaylight.show" should always work, even if the site moves again or similar. Note that it does *not* have the WWW in front, however the page you are viewing now does.
