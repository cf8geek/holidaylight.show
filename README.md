### Hello all!
This is the new website, as some had issues with the Google Drive link.  
If you prefer that, it is still available (and has more information) [here](https://r.ageek.us/2IASDzq).  
Some people have reported it works if you _don't_ open with the Google Drive app on your phone, instead using your web browser.

### Information:
More information will be published later.

## Current status:
Significant maintenance is in progress. Christmas is up next, and it's not likely to be ready until sometime mid-December.  
I would recommend checking back sometime late November for updates!

As always, you can contact me if you have questions, concerns, etc.
