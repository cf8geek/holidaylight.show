### Hello all!

As of the 2025 holiday season preparations, this is the *only* website for status information, schedule, etc. The Google Drive variant has been decommissioned.

### Information:

Work has started - if you drive by, you may see blinky lights, but it is not ready yet. Two major components have been replaced, with at least one more major component needing to be prepared and replaced. Check back later (Mid-October 2025) for more information. I have pulled down a bad LED strip and need to get it replaced. I also need to program the new Halloween song for this year.  

# Current status:

Preparing for the 2025 Q4 holiday season.

As always, you can [contact me](https://r.ageek.us/mnbWuX) if you have questions, concerns, etc.


### Next holiday:

Probably Halloween.


#### Reminder:

The link "holidaylight.show" should always work, even if the site moves again or similar. Note that it does *not* have the WWW in front, however the page you are viewing now does.
