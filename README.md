### Hello all!
This is the new website, as some had issues with the Google Drive link.  
If you prefer that, it is still available (and has more information) at [GoogleSheet.HolidayLight.Show](https://googlesheet.holidaylight.show).  
Some people have reported it works if you _don't_ open with the Google Drive app on your phone, instead using your web browser.

### Information:
Check back mid-to-late September 2025 for more information. 

# Current status:
Done for the 2024 Q4 holiday season.

As always, you can [contact me](https://r.ageek.us/mnbWuX) if you have questions, concerns, etc.


### Next holiday:
Probably Halloween.


#### Reminder:
The link "holidaylight.show" should always work, even if the site moves again or similar. Note that it does *not* have the WWW in front, however the page you are viewing now does.
